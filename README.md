# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail customer transaction data to understand purchasing behavior, identify revenue drivers, and uncover actionable business insights. The workflow combines Python-based data preparation, SQL-based analytical querying, and interactive Power BI dashboards to support data-driven decision making.

## Business Problem
Retail organizations often collect large volumes of transaction data but lack clear visibility into:
- Which customer segments contribute most to revenue
- How purchasing behavior varies across demographics
- What factors influence spending patterns
- How to present insights effectively for decision-makers

This project addresses these questions through structured data analysis and visualization.
